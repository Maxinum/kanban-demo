# Kanban

Kanban is a powerful project management and workflow visualization tool that helps teams optimize their productivity and workflow efficiency. It allows teams to organize tasks, visualize work progress, and prioritize activities in a highly visual and flexible manner. The Kanban methodology was initially developed by Toyota for their manufacturing process but has been widely adopted in various industries and software development teams.

## Features
- Drag and Drop: Move tasks across different columns to indicate their progress in real-time.
- Task Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks on the Kanban board to keep track of your team's work.
- Task Details: Add descriptions, due dates to tasks for more detailed information.
- Prioritize Tasks: Arrange tasks based on their priority to focus on critical items first.
